# Covariate-adjusted kernel RV test

The covariate-adjusted kernel RV (KRV) test evaluates the generalized association between two multivariate (and potentially high-dimensional) variables, while adjusting for covariates. It is implemented as part of the `KRV()` function in the [MiRKAT R package](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=MiRKAT), which is a comprehensive R package for association analysis of microbiome data. In this [vignette](https://pearl-liu.github.io/Covariate-Adjusted-KRV/vignette.html), we introduce the usage of the `KRV()` function and demonstrate its application in genetic association analysis of microbiome composition.
